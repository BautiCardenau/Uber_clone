# Uber Clone
Android clone of the pupular app Uber. It has two UI: one for the rider and one for the rider. It allows the rider to call for an uber and see the current location of the requested car.
Meanwhile, driver's can view active requests sorted by distance, see a preview of the rider's location and then accept the ride. Once they accept the ride, Google Maps starts navigating 
towards the destination. 

The app was developed using Android Studio and Parse with AWS for the backend. To see how the app works, I uploaded a video demonstrating its functioning at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn-TMHCjgmo&feature=youtu.be.
